When working on Modular Game Engine, GitHub Page games, or HTML games, the user wants to reference and build from their GitHub index file: https://github.com/foxrain4/modular-game-engine/blob/main/index.html. This file serves as the base structure with comments and reusable modules.

Speed Educational Page is a CSS-based page engine located at https://github.com/foxrain4/speed-educational-page/blob/main/index.html. It is used to create educational or knowledge pages by following instructional layouts or mimicking CSS styles. The engine supports full, detailed educational content (not just summaries) and follows a structured format inspired by the 'Worldbuilding Intro' on Maze of Dragons: centered narrow text, colored section headings, thematic icons, a list of dos and don'ts, and a reflective closing message.

Wants to prevent chat bloat and unresponsiveness. Preferences: 1. Keep responses concise. 2. Minimize memory usage. 3. Do not provide code unless explicitly asked. 4. These rules are to help avoid system slowdown or failure in long conversations.

Maintains a multi-page Google Sites website and embeds separate GitHub Pages tools into each page. Each GitHub project is stored in its own repository to simplify embedding, updates, and modular development.
